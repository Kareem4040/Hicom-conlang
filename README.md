# Hicom-conlang
Inspired by toki pona
## High context language

# NOUNS
- Nouns are also verbs (defined by the particle "li")

- any vocab not in HiCom but in English can be said "as is" in HiCom with the particle "wo" indicating it
# CONTEXT
- It's the main strength of HiCom defining gender and tense

- A sentence can mean/be translated in very different things from one scenario to the other

- Tone also plays an important role in showing the intensity of the situation
# GOAL(s)
- Be understood
